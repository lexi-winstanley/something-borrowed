# Something Borrowed

## Description
Something Borrowed is a web application that facilitates friend-to-friend lending to help users save money and reduce wasteful purchasing of items to be used only once or twice. Once users create an account they can create or request to join existing groups and add items they are willing to lend out to the members of those groups. They can view the items that the other group members have added and make requests to borrow them. The requester and item owner can then message back and forth until a location and time for pickup are agreed upon and then the owner can confirm the request. If a mutually agreeable location and time cannot be found the owner can deny the request or the requester can delete it. This was completed as a group project during UW Coding Bootcamp.
